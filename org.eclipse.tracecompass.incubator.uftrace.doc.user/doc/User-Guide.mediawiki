From [https://github.com/namhyung/uftrace the uftrace github page]. The uftrace tool is a tool that
traces and analyzes the execution of a program written in C/C++. It was heavily inspired by the ftrace
framework of the Linux kernel (especially function graph tracer) and supports userspace programs. It
supports various kind of commands and filters to help analyze the program execution and performance.

This extension supports UfTrace traces. It populates a call graph and therefore will pupulate most
of the views of the generic callstack analysis.

The parser handles native uftrace traces. In order to open one, select any file within a uftrace
directory.
